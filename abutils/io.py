    Reads sequence data from a file and returns ``abutils.Seqeunce`` objects.

    Args:
    -----

    file (str): path to a file containing sequence data in any of the supported formats.

    format (str): format of the sequence file. Supported formats are: ``'tabular'``, ``'fasta'``,
        ``'json'`` and ``'mongodb'``. Default is ``'tabular'``.

    sep (str): character used to separate fields in ``'tabular'`` input files. This option is
        only used when ``format`` is ``'tabular'``. Default is ``'\t'``, which conforms with the 
        default format for AIRR-compatible sequence annotation.

    id_key (str): name of the field containing the sequence ID. Default is ``'sequence_id'``.

    sequence_key (str): name of the field containing the sequence. Default is ``'sequence'``.

    db (str): mongodb database to query for sequence information. Required if ``format`` is ``'mongodb'``.

    collection (str): mongodb collection to query for sequence information. Required if ``format`` is ``'mongodb'``.

    mongodb_kwargs (dict): dictionary containing additional keyword arguments that will be passed to 
        ``abutils.io.from_mongodb``.
    

    Returns:
    --------

    A list of ``abutils.Sequence`` objects.
