    Set up logging using the built-in ``logging`` package.

    A stream handler is added to all logs, so that logs at or above
    ``logging.INFO`` level are printed to screen as well as written
    to the log file.

    Arguments:

        logfile (str): Path to the log file. If the parent directory
            does not exist, it will be created. Required.

        print_log_location (bool): If ``True``, the log path will be
            written to the log upon initialization. Default is ``True``.

        debug (bool): If true, the log level will be set to ``logging.DEBUG``.
            If ``False``, the log level will be set to ``logging.INFO``.
            Default is ``False``.
